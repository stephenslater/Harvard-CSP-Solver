Remaining tasks:

Important:
- Use the sources we cited in project proposal, since this is part of rubric
- Remove unnecessary columns from excel
- Consolidate "remove from future" and "don't take after" columns
	- E.g. after 121, don't take 50. Currently the 50's might be in wrong column
- MRV (maybe get info from sources?)
- LCV (same as above)
- Plot runtimes of different algorithms/heuristics
- Compare runtimes theoretically
- Testing
- Report

Maybe:
- AC-3
- Local search algorithm
- Clean up OOP code (potentially put Semester class within CSP_Solver)
